Reciter of L'Amuravela for 32 years. He had been Diego's prompter. In the year 1948, when he was 19 years old, due to the fact that Diego had enlisted in a boat that fished bonito based in San Juan de la Arena, instead of resting on the day of San Pedro, he was given the day of the festivity of said town, San Juan. Not finding a volunteer, it was when "Totó" made his debut.

Subsequently, from 1954 to 1984, without interruption, he has been the great reciter of the typical pixueto sermon, always written during this time by his mother Elvira Bravo. Upon her death, in 1986, he took on the responsibility of writing L'Amuravela, until 1993.
