In 1983, "Totó" made the decision to leave L'Amuravela. Various events forced him to continue until 1984, but he was already looking for a substitute.

The following year, 1985, Cesáreo Marqués Valle took over and since then he has been the current reciter of L'Amuravela.

In the words of "Totó": "we have been very lucky, because Cesáreo gives the measure and the size".

Since 1995, he is also its author.
