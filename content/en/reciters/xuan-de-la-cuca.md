Reciter of L'Amuravela around the year 1900 or 1901. He went to the procession in the presidency, with a white jacket, a sash and a very strange hat in his hand. It was because of having gone too far with the verses of the sermon, so the parish priest refused to allow him to continue in the following years. L'Amuravela was suspended until 1946.

Some of the verses of discord were:

> If there is no fish or bread,\
by sword you go to the ground,\
I take the keys to heaven,\
and I give them to Saint John
