In 1946, after having been suspended since 1902, L'Amuravela was restored without the presence of San Pedro. Antón de la Colona was the first to inaugurate it. He was the reciter and author of the sermon, with the help of Elvira Bravo. He was an old sailor, very intelligent, an improviser and a great reciter of ballads. The following year he died.
