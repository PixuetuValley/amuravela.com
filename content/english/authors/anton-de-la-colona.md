In 1946, after having been suspended since 1902, L'Amuravela was revived without the presence of San Pedro. Antón de la Colona was the first to inaugurate it. He was the reciter and author of the sermon, with the help of Elvira Bravo.

In the words of Juan Luis Alvarez Bravo "Totó": "My mother Elvira Bravo, made L'Amuravela since 1946 and helped Antón de la Colona who was the one who made it that year, by the way, in Spanish. Antón de la Colona made it, my mother corrected it, not in ideas, but in the technical part, in terms of rhymes, etc.
